The intention of my screensaver is to create a moving object that continuously leaves a trail behind its motion.
I used a code made by Owen Roberts (https://editor.p5js.org/owenroberts/sketches/BknrFeynx) which I based my screensaver on.
Roberts's screensaver contains a square moving around in a zigzag path in a very slow motion.
I changed my code to a circle moving in a faster direction as well as different spacing so the trail behind the circle is more noticeable
rather than Roberts's square staying in the same spot all the time.
Roberts's code originally had a transparent background, but I filled the background with white in the case of
others viewing the code in the editor in the dark or high contrast modes.
I believe the white background makes the black outline of the circles stand out.
When the circle moves, the diagonal trails that form intertwine together and they make an interesting looking texture.
Overall, I am pleased with my final product of my screensaver.  Every time I look at it, it is very hypnotizing.
Not only does it function as a screensaver, but I also believe it can be a great tool to provide comfort and relaxation for those under stress.  Here is the link to my screensaver: https://editor.p5js.org/ChloeCassandra/sketches/ZXO0rN6g7
